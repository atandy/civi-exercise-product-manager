# civi-exercise-product-manager
Take-Home exercise for growth product manager candidates at Civi.


## Exercise Summary

### Scenario
Assume that you have just joined a company that has a new mobile app that has 100 beta testers. The mobile app is simple: it is a free app for tracking real estate prices and available properties that are for sale throughout all of Latin America.

The 100 beta testers are all friends and family, and so far they’ve provided you with good feedback on the app; they “really like it”! 

You are now preparing to launch this application to a wider audience and you will be in charge of growing the user base. 

### Here are some questions we have for you:

* What is your application launch strategy? How would you approach this? What tests would you run?
* How would you grow the user base to 5,000 in 30 days with a budget of $5000 USD?
* What metrics would you be focused on? Why?
* What are some questions you would try to have answered immediately?
* What would you use to analyze the data?
* How would you prove that the app is working and adds values for users? How do you prove success?
* What product features might you anticipate needing to build or how might results inform the product roadmap?
* Bonus: How might you monetize this product in the future?

## Exercise Deliverables and Submissions
### Exercise Format
For this assignment, you are welcome to create and submit the exercise in any format you would like: e.g word document, presentation (keynote, powerpoint, etc.). However, keep in mind that you could later be asked to present your work and talk through your approach. 

### Time Allocation
